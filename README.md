### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer at Vanguard and a graduate of the Computer & Information Technology Master's program at the University of Pennsylvania. I continuously add new projects here as I think of them and have time to complete them - check back every once in a while for updates!

Before studying at the University of Pennsylvania, I graduated with a Bachelor of Music (Pipe Organ Performance) and a Certificate in Harpsichord Studies from the Curtis Institute of Music.
