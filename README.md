### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a current software engineer at Vanguard and a graduate of the Computer & Information Technology Master's program at the University of Pennsylvania. Some of the content on these repositories is from my time in school, but I continuously add new projects as I think of them and have time to complete them - check back every once in a while for updates!

Before studying at the University of Pennsylvania, I graduated with a Bachelors in Music from the Curtis Institute of Music, and I still occasionally play both piano and pipe organ.
